# Project MonoGamePlus

**Project Status: Early Development**

### About

This repository aims to provide a **"Ready-to-Go" game engine solution built on top of MonoGame**. Unlike engines that are built from scratch based on abstract design principles, my approach is inspired by industry practices, similar to how Unreal Engine was born from a shipping title. The core of this engine will be extracted and refined from an ongoing commercial game project, ensuring that every feature and system is battle-tested and production-ready.

### My Philosophy

I believe that the best tools are forged in the fires of real-world application. This project is not an academic exercise; it's a practical toolkit designed to get you from concept to a playable game as efficiently as possible.

My primary goal is to lower the barrier to entry for game development, especially for individual and small teams. While powerful, C++-based engines can often have a steep learning curve and slow down development cycles for new developers. By leveraging MonoGame and C#, I aim to offer a solution that is both performant and easy to use, allowing creators to focus on what matters most: bringing their creative vision to life.

### What to Expect

In this repository, you'll find concrete implementations of high-level concepts from modern game development, all built on top of the MonoGame engine. This includes essential business logic for features like **camera systems**, **UI elements** (buttons, scroll menus), and other common high-level business logic for both **2D and 3D projects**.

You may notice that some of the underlying MonoGame engine code in this repository differs from the official version. For example, I've made specific modifications to achieve higher render batch submission efficiency and support for static/dynamic batching. Extracting and refining this code into a versatile framework requires careful consideration and balance. It is a demanding and lengthy process of continuous iteration and evolution.

### Current Status

As this engine is a byproduct of an active commercial project, **updates will be intermittent**. This is a passion project that I'll be contributing to during my spare time. The features and updates you see here will directly reflect the progress and needs of the primary game, guaranteeing a steady flow of practical, proven code.

### Contributions

Due to the project's early and unstable state, I am currently **not accepting code contributions or collaboration** from the community. Once the engine has reached a more stable and well-defined architecture, I will welcome external contributions.

In the meantime, feel free to open issues to provide feedback or suggest features. Your input will help shape the future direction of this project.
